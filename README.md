# Pokemon Database
This was a group project between Rishabh Verma, Avery Feldman, and Jonah Feldman for SI 206 F22 at the University of Michigan, School of Information. This program utilizes information from the PokeApi, Pokemon Go API, and Bulbapedia Website in order to create a database which displays information about all of the pokemon- specifically moves, abilities, and type. Currently, there is a maximum limit of 25 entries per data table when it comes to adding Pokemon information, but this can be adjusted by going to line 902 in functions.cpp, and changing the integer argument to a different integer instead. For example, changing the value to 50 would make a limit of 50 pokemon, abilities, and moves being added to the tables instead. Additonal information about the project can be found under report.
